# For svn, you need to create ~/.subversion/servers containing:

# http-proxy-host = "##PROXY##"
# http-proxy-port = "##PROXY_PORT##"


# To use git with a proxy, you must use an external git proxy command, such as
# the one provided by scripts/oe-git-proxy.sh. To use this script, copy it to
# your PATH and uncomment the following:
##GIT_PROXY_COMMAND## 

# Global proxy definition
##ALL_PROXY##

# Uncomment this to use a shared download directory
#DL_DIR = "/some/shared/download/directory/"
